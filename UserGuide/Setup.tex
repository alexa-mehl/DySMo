\section{Setting up DySMo}

In order to work with DySMo you need to install the Python Simulation Library, which can be found here \url{https://gitlab.tubit.tu-berlin.de/a.mehlhase/PySimulationLibrary}.
Please follow the instructions in its user guide.

To get DySMo you can either clone the repository or download a snapshot in ZIP-format from \url{https://gitlab.tubit.tu-berlin.de/amsun/dysmo}.
The "Download ZIP"-button is next to the plus-button and the "Global" button with the bell-symbol.
