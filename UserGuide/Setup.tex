\section{Setting up DySMo}

In order to work with DySMo you need to install the Python Simulation Library, which can be found here \url{https://gitlab.tubit.tu-berlin.de/a.mehlhase/PySimulationLibrary}.
Please follow the instructions in its user guide.
We assume that you've added Python to PATH, so that you can call Python from everywhere (see PySimLib documentation for details).
If you haven't, all calls to Python in this document have to be preceded by the path to the Python executable.
\\
To get DySMo you can either clone the repository or download a snapshot in ZIP-format from \url{https://gitlab.tubit.tu-berlin.de/amsun/dysmo}.
The "Download ZIP"-button is next to the plus-button and the "Global" button with the bell-symbol.
